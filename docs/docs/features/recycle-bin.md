# Recycle Bin

The Recycle Bin protects you from accidentally deleting important items and lists.

## How It Works

When you delete:

- **Items** go to the recycle bin for 30 days
- **Lists** go to the recycle bin for 30 days
- After 30 days, items are permanently deleted

## Accessing the Recycle Bin

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Recycle Bin**
3. Browse deleted items and lists

## Restoring Items

1. Go to **Settings** → **Recycle Bin**
2. Find the item or list
3. Tap **Restore**
4. Item returns to its original list

## Permanent Deletion

To permanently delete before 30 days:

1. Open **Recycle Bin**
2. Select item/list
3. Tap **Delete Permanently**
4. Confirm

!!! warning "Cannot Be Undone"
Permanent deletion is irreversible. The data cannot be recovered.

## Storage Management

Recycle bin items count toward your storage quota. Empty the bin periodically to free up space.

## Best Practices

- Review recycle bin weekly
- Restore accidentally deleted items promptly
- Empty bin monthly to free space
- Don't rely on it as backup—export important lists
