2. Sort categories in order you encounter them
3. Shop systematically through the store

**Example for Grocery Store:**

1. Produce (front of store)
2. Bakery (usually near produce)
3. Dairy (back corners)
4. Frozen (center aisles)
5. Pantry (center aisles)
6. Household (back aisles)

## Best Practices
